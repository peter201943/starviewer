# Scenes

(Not to be confused with "Godot Scenes").
These are 3D scenes that a Deployment uses.
(Since the Stars are 3D objects, they need a 3D scene to be loaded into, not just a 2D UI).

These are 3D environments (backgrounds, etcetera) with instantiated UI.

The `tests/` are simple, small, specific scenes for testing particular features or concepts.
