# StarViewer

The User Interface components to the StarViewer app.

The minimal UI frame/border shown around a star when it is being viewed.

IDEA: Show stars with more than 1 instance as a group!

Is a simple frame/border UI with buttons to open other menus:
- Open the "Search"
- "Next Star" (of current user)
- "Previous Star" (of current user)
