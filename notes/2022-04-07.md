## Background
- Lisa has been interested in having a "starviewer" for almost a year

## Initial Thoughts
- Lisa would like an in-browser stylish 3d-model dynamically-loaded rest-enabled viewer
- Lisa thinks Godot-Game-Engine is the best way to do this (I agree)
- What are the problems I forsee, what tutorials will be helpful, and how ought this be organized?

## Problems

### 1. Dynamically Loading 3D Models and 3D Textures (in Godot)
- There are some discussions on doing this
- A question is how to **do** this
- Another question is how to **host** this (servers, etc)

### 2. Hosting the Godot Client
- Why is this necessary?
  - Internet Browsers still prohibit local-execution (file access, though some work into providing sandboxed environments is still ongoing), and as such expect the content to be delivered by a server, even if that content is totally static
    - (TODO @peter investigate whether new export options for Godot exist)
- Why might Neocities be problematic?
  - (NOTICE, research necessary)
  - Godot does not really require anything special, it just needs a port open to serve it
    - Neocities might forbid this, will need to experiment to determine for certain
- If Neocities is not suitable, what other options exist?
  - After Frank's recent terrible experience with Google Firebase Functions and Google Firestore, this will require some research
  - Since this is ostensibly very little computation, a low-cost server would be preferable
    - Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and other "Cloud Hosting Solutions" ought to be looked at
      - **ALTERNATIVELY**, might be able to host with Itch.IO and embed in a container (iframe)
        - Although will still inherit the very annoying Itch container (edges of box)

### 3. Stylish UI
- Lisa really likes the retro 90's web ui, some effort should be spent investigating the ability to build UI's like this in Godot
- Also some education with regards to the `WebLinkButton` Godot Object would be wise
- Another question is what features of a viewer is Lisa looking for, and how to enable rapid development
  - Spinning up a web server each time a UI change is made is not desirable
    - Perhaps configuring some `TestEnvironment.tscn` would be wise to enable this workstyle

### 4. Maintainability
- Godot 4 will come out at somepoint, and has some differences from Godot 3
- It would be wise to configure the starviewer repo to have three branches:
  - `main` (have this be whatever is finally used)
  - `godot3` (have this be what `main` is until godot 4 is fully released and then use this to archive that work)
  - `godot4` (do some preemptive work here for when godot 4 is adopted)
- Also want to configure `.gitmodules` in the main Lisa repo to pull the starviewer repo into a folder
  - Should this pull something from the StarViewer **Releases** page, or from the **Repo**?
    - It would be really annoying to keep recompiling a web-release of the StarViewer each time a change to the larger Lisa project is made
      - Best then to **not** use `.gitmodules` and instead manually grab the latest release of StarViewer for the main project

### 5. Refreshing the Webpage
- Will need to be aware of the typically large size of a Godot HTML export, refreshing the webpage constantly is not great (lots of network traffic)
- May be wise to override/intercept the `F5` signal and use to implement as own functionality

### 6. Rest Requests
- I do not think this will be a problem, but I mention it anyways to acknowledge that it is still an aspect of the project that needs addressing
- It has been a few years since I did this in Godot, so I should practice doing it again
