## Trouble Accessing the Deployment Settings
- This is turning into more of an annoyance than I thought
- `user://` (which is where I intended to put `settings.json`) is *not* the deployment-location of the final "app"
- Instead it is a local-data folder (which, tbf, is probably wiser than some folder in `Program Files`)
- Such as `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\[project_name]`
- This complicates things for "deployment" because finding `settings.json` alongside the `index.html` is not going to work
- (Also, the `user://` for HTML exports is a fake folder that gets deleted on app close, just fyi)
- (Also Also, the `user://` is *not* a folder on the *deployment server*, but instead on the *visiting client*)

- Which now brings me to pondering how to store deployment settings?
- Could define a class for `StarViewer` with an exported variable to choose which export option
- Or have two scenes that subtype `StarViewer` and set this variable for exporting
- The only problem is now if someone wants to change a setting, they must download the Godot Editor and Starviewer Project just so they can change a string
- ("godot html scan directory")
- [Listing directories in exported project returns only *.import files #25672](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/25672)

- Hmmm, this is also going to impact the ability to load models/textures
- Oh! How could I be so dumb, of course it's going to affect it!
- Models/Textures must *necessarily* be accessed through REST and not just as "local files" (gosh what was I thinking...)
- There are a few solutions to this, but all will involve the elimination of the use of `path` and require the use of `endpoint`
- 1.  - Require all model and texture files be included inside the project itself
      - Require all settings (app mode and user stars location) be set inside the project itself
  2.  - Set the model/texture/stars endpoints inside the `index.html` as a javascript variable and access via javascript calls (Godot)
- ("godot html get server name")

- Tried adding this block to `index.js` at the top:
```javascript
// <StarViewer:settings>
var StarViewerSettings = {
	// These are settings used tby the StarViewer app for loading resources.
	// Please modify for your installation.
	// These were automatically generated for the `dev` deployment.
  // `localhost:8005` is arbitrary, if errors in loading exist, check the serving port!
	// See `starviewer/app/deployments/readme.md` for more information.

	app_mode: 	"dev",
	app_env: 		"web",
	models: 		"localhost:8005/models/",
	textures: 	"localhost:8005/textures/",
	stars: 			"localhost:8005/warpzone/stars.json",
	semantics: 	"[\"2022-04-18\", \"null-warpzone-starviewer\", \"version-1\"]"
}
// </StarViewer:settings>
```
- (this will require some modification to the parsing rules)
- decided to add `app_env` (for now) to indicate which environment it's deployed to (not sure yet if I like this)
- notice how all the resources are endpoints, as opposed to paths, since there does not appear to be a way for godot to tell the name of the server it is running on
- also added a `semantics` key because I realized tracking the version of this config and other stuff is hard to predict in advance and may be potentially useful in the future
- (yes, it is using embedded-json notation)

- Tried moving this to `deployments/dev/index.html` inside a `<script>` tag, will need to investigate hTML templates for Godot

## UI Redesign
- The `UsersStarScreen` and `SearchScreen` should be parented under the `StarView`
- What is the distinction between the `StarView` and `StarViewer`?
- True, one does seem to be more oriented around handling UI, whereas the other might be more interested in holding certain settings
- But why not collapse them into the same entity?
- Also consider moving the folder-location of these scenes to make more sense

## Misc Todo
- move helper functions to `Utility.gd`
- rename `settings.gd` to `App.gd`
- move `app/concepts/setting/App.gd` to `app/`
- reformat `app/ui/` to `app/`

## Singletons
- question does there even need to be a `settings.gd` singleton?
- consider that the only person really accessing this stuff so far is `StarViewer`
- does anyone else really need to use this?
- maybe these should be held by `StarViewer` itself, but let settings handle the loading

## Who Should Handle the Networking
- Should the `Star` or the `Settings` handle model/texture networking?
- And who should handle `UserStars` networking?
- Should all networking be handled by `Settings`?
- Or should `UserSearch` handle its networking and `Star` handle its networking?
